## uv
**uv** is a web application under development designed to consist of independent open-source JavaScript libraries, developed in-house which can be used elsewhere based on requirements.

Currently 2 components are under development, namely:
- *uvCharts*

> A no non-sense charting library built on top of d3.js which prioritizes ease of use and intuitiveness over everything else. A unified data format across all charts, single configuration object makes it easy to learn and master.

- *uvData*

> A data manipulation library designed to operate on a list of records (represented by plain JS Objects). The library draws inspiration from Miso Dataset.

As on 1st July 2013, uvCharts is nearing its first public release and we're very excited about it.
